# Ecommerce Management DBMS Project

As a part of our University Curriculum, we made this project for Database Management Systems (DBMS) - ITE1003.<br>
This project contains theoretical as well as implementation in SQL.<br>
If you liked the repo do :star: it.

## 1. Mini world and Description

In this modern era of online shopping no seller wants to be left behind, moreover due to its simplicity the shift from offline selling model to an online selling model is witnessing a rampant growth.<br>
Therefore, as an engineer our job is to ease the path of this transition for the seller.
Amongst many things that an online site requires the most important is a database system. Hence in this project we are planning to design a database where small clothing sellers can sell their product online.

## 2. Basic Structure

### 2.1 Functional requirement

- A new user can register on the website.
- A customer can see details of the product present in the cart
- A customer can view his order history.
- Admin can start a sale with certain discount on every product.
- Customer can filter the product based on the product details.
- A customer can add or delete a product from the cart.
- A seller can unregister/ stop selling his product.
- A seller/ customer can update his details.
- Admin can view the products purchased on particular date.
- Admin can view number of products sold on a particular date.
- A customer can view the total price of product present in the cart unpurchased.
- Admin can view details of customer who have not purchased anything.
- Admin can view total profit earned from the website.

## 3. Implementation

You can directly copy and paste all the commands from the text given here into the SQL console to create and insert values into your table.

### 3.1 Creating Tables

```sql
    CREATE TABLE Cart
    (
        Cart_id VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY(Cart_id)
    );

    CREATE TABLE Customer
    (
        Customer_id VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
        c_pass VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
        Name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
        Address VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
        Pincode int NOT NULL,
        Phone_number_s number(10) NOT NULL,

        FOREIGN KEY(Cart_id) REFERENCES cart(Cart_id)
    );

    CREATE TABLE Seller

        Seller_id VARCHAR(6),
        PRIMARY KEY (Product_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (Seller_id) REFERENCES Seller(Seller_id)
        ON DELETE SET NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE Cart_item
    (
        Quantity_wished int NOT NULL,
        Date_Added DATE NOT NULL,
        Cart_id VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
        Product_id VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (Cart_id) REFERENCES Cart(Cart_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (Product_id) REFERENCES Product(Product_id),
        Primary key(Cart_id,Product_id)
    );

    alter table Cart_item add purchased varchar(3) default 'NO';
```

### 3.2 Inserting Values

These are some demo values. Full data will be updated in future commits

```sql
    insert into Cart values('crt1011');

    insert into Customer values('cid100','ABCM1235','rajat','G-453','632014',9893135876, 'crt1011');

    insert into Seller values('sid100','12345','aman','delhi cmc');

    insert into Product values('pid1001','jeans','red','32','M',10,10005,20,'sid100');

    insert into Seller_Phone_num values('9943336206','sid100');

    insert into Cart_item values(3,to_date('10-OCT-1999','dd-mon-yyyy'),'crt1011','pid1001','Y');

    insert into Payment values('pmt1001',to_date('10-OCT-1999','dd-mon-yyyy'),'online','cid100','crt1011',NULL);
```

## 4. Queries

### 4.1 Basic Queries

#### If the customer wants to see details of product present in the cart

```sql
    select * from product where product_id in(
        select product_id from Cart_item where (Cart_id in (
            select Cart_id from Customer where Customer_id='cid100'
        ))
    and purchased='NO');
```

#### If a customer wants to see order history

```sql
    select product_id,Quantity_wished from Cart_item where (purchased='Y' and Cart_id in (select Cart_id from customer where Customer_id='cid101'));
```

```
#### If a customer want to know the total price present in the cart

```sql
    select sum(quantity_wished * cost) total_payable from product p join cart_item c on p.product_id=c.product_id where c.product_id in (select product_id from cart_item where cart_id in(select Cart_id from customer where customer_id='cid101') and purchased=’Y’);
```

    id product.product_id%type;
    cursor cf is
    select product_id,cost,type from product where cost<c and type=t;
    begin
    open cf;
    loop
    fetch cf into id,cs,ty;
    exit when cf%notfound;
    dbms_output.put_line('Product' || id || 'has cost ' || cs || ' and the type is' || ty);
    end loop;
    close cf;
    exception
    when no_data_found then
    dbms_output.put_line('Sorry no such products exist');
    end;

```

#### Function which returns total number of products which a particular seller sells

```sql
    create or replace function totalProducts(sId in varchar)
    return number

    begin
    select count(*) into total
    from product
    where seller_id=sId;
    return total;
    end;
    /
```
Function execution:
```sql
    declare
    c number(2);
    begin
    c:=totalProducts('sid102');
    dbms_output.put_line('Total products is : '|| c);
    end;
```

#### Procedure which returns the total quantity of product with the given ID
Procedure with exception handling

    is
    quan number(2);
    begin
    select quantity into quan from product where product_id=p_id;
    exception

    dbms_output.put_line('Sorry no such product exist !!');
    end;
    /
```
### 4.3 Triggers
#### Trigger that will execute before inserting new customer to database and inserting a new cartId to the cart_items table
Function to count number of cart items

    n number(2);
    begin
    c:= :new.cart_id;
    n:=numCartId(c);
    if n>0 then
    dbms_output.put_line('Sorry');
    end if;
    insert into cart values(c);
    end;
```
#### Trigger to update the total amount of user everytime he adds something to payment table
```sql
    create or replace function total_cost(cId in varchar)
    return number
    is
    total number(2) :=0;
    begin
    select sum(cost) into total from product,cart_item where product.product_id=cart_item.product_id and cart_id=cId;
    return total;
    end;

    create or replace trigger before_pay_up
    before insert
    on
    payment
    for each row
    declare
    total number(3);
    begin
    total :=total_cost(:new.cart_id);
    insert into payment values(:new.payment_id,:new.payment_date,:new.payment_type,:new.customer_id,:new.cart_id,total);
